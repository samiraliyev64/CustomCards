                        <p id="description">Member of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassins, Altaïr was the first historic Assassin introduced in the original Assassin’s Creed game. 
                                            Born in Syria, he served as Mentor to the Levantine Brotherhood and was the first Assassin to discover the ‘Apple of Eden’ – a gold circular orb that pretty much grants the user unlimited power. 
                                            Altaïr’s influence across the Old World helped shape the Order, writing details in his fabled codex for later generations to discover.

                                            The Florentine nobleman finds out that his father and uncle served with the Assassin’s and, with some training from Uncle Mario, he becomes an Assassin himself – embarking on missions to kill those responsible for the death of his family.

                        <p id="description">Edward sailed the seven seas in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag - the first AC game to predominantly feature pirate-theme voyages with a large ocean to sail across, as well as various islands to explore. 
                                            Father of Haytham Kenway, and grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton, Edward takes on Templars within the British and Spanish empires who have located the Sage, the only man that can lead them to the Observatory – a First Civilization device which will allow them to spy on, and blackmail, world leaders.

                            It's all about that growl. When Eivor talks, even when joking around with her mead-soaked comrades, there’s always an edge—a promise that, if shit goes down, she's ready to whip out her axe and start chopping off heads. It's a simmering ferocity that's with her at all times in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and when a raspy, snarling threat doesn’t prove that she means business, that's when the whirlwind of destruction begins.

                                            Later in life, Shay trained his son and grandson in learning to master Freerunning and Eagle Vision. They also inherited his air rifle. Shay remained a Templar to his death, having never betrayed the Templar Order.
